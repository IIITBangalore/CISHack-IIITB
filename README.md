# WeScribe

### Team: Thunderbirds

WeScribe is a platform that allows collaboration while attending live lectures on Zoom or Youtube. 

An added plus is that the collaboration is completely optional and hence the user can also use it to watch the lectures while writing their ideas on the editor. 

To resonate its use even more and increase the participation of students while online learning, we also have a WeScribe discord bot which helps in keeping students motivated and engaged with their fellow peers.

Refer to our [presentation](./WeSribe.pptx) for more details about the idea and the platform.

## Hosting 

The frontend is hosted on gh-pages at https://gaganagarwal77.github.io/WeScribe-Frontend/ and the WeScribe discord bot is deployed on heroku.

You can test all it's functionalities by running the backend locally. To run the backend locally please refer to the readme of the linked Backend repo.
